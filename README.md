# About
This is a project that I worked on in my Junior Year for Software Engineering. We utilized OpenCV's Java Library to create an image processing and character recognition software for the FAA.
Keep in mind this was a semester long project and the program is filled with bugs, and unpolished and unfinished features. It may not even work anymore due to OpenCV being a fiddle to get it working.
This repo contains all of the source files and the JARs for the executible programs. The JARs SHOULD be able to run without installing OpenCV (I hope)
Use the sample image file located in the folders or an image inside one of the images folder to test out the program (if you want).

# Where is everything?
The CommandLineProgram ane the GUIPRogram folders contain all of the source files for the program.
The Executable folder contains the JARs and all of the files required to run the program as well as the documentation.
